## What is Underscore?

Underscore (http://undersco.re) is an alternative, modular, data-broker-resistant infrastructure stack and core ongoing R&D lab project administered primarily by The New Design Congress, with ongoing input from a number of aligned organizations. 

Underscore is framed and developed entirely from a community-first perspective. This means that beyond data liberation, Underscore is unique in its implementation of community identity, and this simple reframing has significant effects on the usability, security, and dynamics of the stack.
